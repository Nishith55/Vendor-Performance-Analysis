# 🧾 Vendor Performance Analysis Project

This project simulates a real-world business case for evaluating vendor performance using **SQL**, **Python**, and **Power BI**—ideal for showcasing Data Analytics skills. We analyze large-scale retail data to generate actionable insights for improving inventory management, pricing strategies, and vendor relationships.

## 📊 Problem Statement

Retail companies often face profitability challenges due to poor vendor selection, inefficient inventory turnover, and suboptimal pricing. This analysis aims to:

- Identify underperforming brands and vendors.
- Evaluate vendor contribution to sales and gross profit.
- Understand the impact of bulk purchasing on cost efficiency.
- Optimize inventory by analyzing turnover and unsold stock.

---

## 🧩 Tools & Technologies

- **SQL** – Data extraction, joins, filtering, and transformation (10M+ rows).
- **Python** – Data wrangling & EDA using Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
- **Power BI** – Dashboard for stakeholder presentation.
- **Jupyter Notebook** – For step-by-step analysis and visualization.

## 🔍 Methodology

1. **Data Acquisition**: Multiple raw datasets with 10M+ records.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Removed invalid/zero values to ensure integrity.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Summary statistics
   - Outlier detection
   - Correlation analysis
4. **Hypothesis Testing**: Statistical validation of profit margin differences.
5. **Data Reduction**: Filtered to ~10K rows for focused business insights.
6. **Visualization**: Power BI dashboard for visual storytelling.

## 📈 Key Insights

- Top 10 vendors contribute 65.69% of total purchases → highlights vendor dependency risk.
- Bulk orders yield 72% lower unit cost → opportunity for strategic procurement.
- $2.71M in unsold inventory → potential for clearance or stock reduction.
- Vendors with high margins but low sales → candidates for pricing/marketing adjustment.
